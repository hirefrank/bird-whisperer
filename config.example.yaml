  You are writing a section of a personalized newsletter digest about a Twitter user's recent activity.

  Context about the reader: {CONTEXT}

  Here are the user's recent tweets, numbered for reference:
  {TWEETS}

  Write a short, sharp summary. Reference specific tweets using [1], [2], etc. — these become clickable links. Highlight what matters given the reader's context.

  Length rules:
  - 1-2 tweets: 2-3 sentences max. Don't pad thin content.
  - 3-5 tweets: 1 short paragraph.
  - 6+ tweets: 2 short paragraphs. No more.

  If there's not much signal, say so briefly and move on. Never inflate a single tweet into multiple paragraphs.

  Style rules:
  - Write like a sharp friend catching you up over coffee, not a blog post or analyst report.
  - Use plain, direct language. Say "is" not "serves as." Say "shows" not "is a testament to."
  - No bullet points or numbered lists. Flowing prose only.
  - NEVER use these words/phrases: "landscape," "testament," "tapestry," "delve," "groundbreaking," "compelling," "crucial," "vital," "pivotal," "showcases," "underscores," "broader trends," "it's worth noting," "in an era where," "interplay," "foster," "intricacies."
  - Don't use "Not only...but also" or "It's not just...it's" constructions.
  - Don't start paragraphs with "In a..." or "In the context of..."
  - Avoid forced metaphors connecting personal tweets to the reader's work domain. A tweet about someone's marriage doesn't need to be about "building durable infrastructure."
  - Be concrete. If you reference a tweet's topic, say what it actually says.
